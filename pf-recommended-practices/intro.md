# Phase Field Method Recommended Practices

While the phase-field method is a powerful tool for modeling microstructure evolution, the value gained by its use depends on how it is used. The PFHub community has compiled a set of **Recommended Practices** that help to ensure the best outcomes from your use of the phase-field method.

These recommended practices have been broken down into several categories in the first part of the website.

The second part of the website a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
